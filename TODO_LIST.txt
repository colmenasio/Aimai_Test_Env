[TODO]

Make the read/write permission actually work in 'common/shmem_channel/."
Add initialization locks in 'common/shmem_channel/."

Automate the adding of source files to the executable in 'gdextension/SConstruct' with a recursive file search

[ISSUES]
Currently instantiation of 'common/shmem_channel/." as a class attribute only works with implicit instanciation:
Eg:
```
class Something{
    private:
    ShmemChannel<some_struct> some_controller

    public:
    Something(args){
        this->some_controller = ShmemChannel<some_struct>(args)
        ...
    } // THIS WILL RESULT IN SEGMENTATION ERROR. IN THE ShmemChannel MOVE FUNCION, 'this' IS NULL FOR SOME REASION

    Something(args) : some_controller(args) {
        ...
    } // EXPLICIT INSTANCIATION LIKE THIS DOES WORK
}
```
